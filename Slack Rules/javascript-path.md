# JavaScript Path

## Why
The goal of a path is to avoid taking the bad way that will guide the person to the most difficult path,
especially for beginners, that almost ever find out those 'ways out'.

## How
It all depends on you, and how you will manage your time and absorb the knowledge. You will take a course, 
guidance and help from other students, all of this are available on the channel to answer your questions
and help you with the code problems.

## Who
Mentors personally recommend the courses, which are free and not sponsored. 
In this way it is possible for anyone to follow them and, 
thanks to the support of the group, to finish them with enthusiasm.
